          We are excited to announce the launch of Yantra, an innovative tech
          fest hosted by VIT Vellore for the first time this year, representing
          a fresh chapter in our universityâ€™s journey of technological
          exploration and creativity. Yantra aims to carry forward the legacy of
          Gravitas, our esteemed annual tech fest, which has attracted numerous
          participants and garnered widespread attention in the past.
          <p class="about-para">
            Yantra will feature an array of engaging competitions, workshops,
            and interactive sessions, designed to challenge participants' skills
            and expand their knowledge across various domains. It will serve as
            a platform for students to showcase their talent, exchange ideas,
            and forge valuable connections with industry experts.
